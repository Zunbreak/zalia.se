      <h2>What is Zalia?</h2>
      <p>
        Zalia is my heart project – a 2.5D, grid-based online world inspired by classics like Tibia,
        but with its own identity. It’s not about meta, battle passes or cash grabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s about exploring a world that doesn’t explain everything, making real choices, and 
        living with the consequences long after the fight is over.
      </p>
      <p>
        You play in an isometric, tile-based world where <strong>the grid is law</strong>:
        movement, combat, line of sight, spells and the environment all respect the tiles.

          <h3>Mystery</h3>
          <p>
            Zalia doesn’t want to tell you everything. Some places are dangerous without warning.
            Some trees are older than empires. Some monsters change based on what has happened
            there before. The world should feel strange – and worth thinking about.

        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Choice</h3>
          <p>
            You are not just your level. Who you help, who you betray, which factions you support
            and which areas you dare to enter early – it all matters more than a simple gear score.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="pillar">
          <h3>Consequence</h3>
          <p>
            The world remembers. Reputation, cities that love or hate you, guards that attack on sight,
            long-term status effects and changed zones – all of it grows out of what players actually do.

      <h2>The Zalia Commitment</h2>
      <p><strong>From the creator</strong></p>
      <p>
        I’m a self-taught solo dev building Zalia. I do this out of stubbornness, curiosity, and a
        bit of anger at how many modern games and systems are designed. Building a project of this
        scope alone is a relentless fight, but it is a fight necessary to achieve this vision.
      </p>
      <p>Zalia is built on these core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Actions carry more weight than marketing or hype.</li>
        <li>The world is persistent; it doesn't reset when it's convenient.</li>
        <li>Players' choices and efforts have real consequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My goal is not maximum profit. I strive to create a sustainable foundation for Zalia so I can
        continue to develop and fully realize this vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to contribute right now is to follow, share, and provide feedback once playable
        builds become available.
      </p>
